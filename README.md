# News Classifier

This project is a News Classifier built using a combination of traditional machine learning and NLP techniques. The goal is to classify news articles into their respective categories using text-based features (news or not-news).

## Project Overview

The `news-classifier` project is designed to determine whether a given text is a news article or not. It employs traditional machine learning algorithms alongside Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify textual data.
